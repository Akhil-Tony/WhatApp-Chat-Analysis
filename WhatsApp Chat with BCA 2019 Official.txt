21/02/21, 7:30 pm - +91 91136 85089: BENGALURU/MANGALURU: Following the increase in cases in neighbouring states, Karnataka on Saturday decided to close all interstate borders with Kerala, barring four major entry points — Talapady, Saradka (Bantwal), Nettanige-Mudnuru (Puttur) and Jalsoor (Sullia). It also made Covid-negative certificates not older than 72 hours must for travellers from Maharashtra, whether they come by road, train or flight.
Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner KV Rajendra said from Monday, travellers from Kerala will have to enter Karnataka and return via four checkposts and health department teams will screen them. All those entering must furnish a Covid-19 negative certificate obtained 72 hours prior to the journey.
Once-in-15-day test must for daily commuters from Kerala
Details of the travellers will be sent to tahsildars, taluk panchayat executive officers and health officials to ensure tracking.
Separate data will be maintained of daily commuters from Kerala, including students and employees. They will have to produce Covid-negative certificates and thereon undergo tests once in 15 days, Rajendra said.
Travellers from Maharashtra, on the other hand, will be screened retrospectively. Those who have arrived in the past two weeks to Karnataka’s colleges, hospitals, nursing homes, hostels, hotels and lodges will be compulsorily subjected to RT-PCR testing, says a government circular. Only those who have already produced a Covid-negative certificate are exempt from testing.
The circular says if there are five or more cases of Covid-19 in hostels, and boarding or residential educational institutions, these will be declared as “containment zones” by health authorities .
Health minister K Sudhakar said border districts have been told to take steps to prevent a spread in the state.

30/04/21, 10:24 am - Zulki BCA🎤: What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is a method used to get great amounts of data from websites and then data can be used for any kind of data manipulation and operation on it.
For this technique, we use web browsers. You usually do not have the built-in option to get that data you want. That is why we use Web Scraping to automate the process of getting that data and not having to do it manually. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process so that instead of manually copying the data from websites.

10/07/21, 3:13 pm - Srijana Mam👩‍🏫: Dear parents and students

           As most of you all are experiencing problems in paying the fees and you have requested time up to 31st July 2021 and agreed to pay before 31st July 2021, the internal exams of fourth and second semester are being postponed to the first and second week of August 2021. 

Kindly ensure that you pay the fees before 31st of July of semester II and semester IV respectively.

Thanks & Regards,
YIASCM
